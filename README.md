SJSU 2024-25 CMPE/SE Senior Project - TES camera board and ML image processing

## user notes
TODO: Format this later...
- How to connect:
  - plug board into power source (not reccomended to power by PC USB port. use a good phone charger)
  - follow the [coral docs](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started) to download Mendel
  - connect coral board to the same wifi as your PC. i had issues getting it to run following the user docs, so I just plugged in a m+kb and monitor to manually connect the wifi.
  - run `mdt shell` -- may require multiple times to detect the device, but once it does it should open an ssh terminal.
